This repository contains the integration with Openstack

# Code Conventions
* Code should be clean, readable, and documented
* Always add unit tests for any meaningful feature or code change
* Add Javadocs when it makes sens
* Remove any Javadocs that are incomplete or empty or that make no sense
* Maintain as much as possible the .gitignore file / use a global .gitignore
* Formatting: Use IntelliJ IDEA default as much as possible; doing so means less configuration hassle
* Donâ€™t add IDE specific files or configurations
