# Code Conventions
* Code should be: clean, readable, and documented (or references present)
* Add unit tests for any meaningful feature or code change, to prove it
* Add Java docs when it makes sens/it helps
* Maintain as much as possible the .gitignore file / use a global .gitignore
* Formatting: Use IntelliJ IDEA default as much as possible
* Donâ€™t add IDE specific files or configurations
